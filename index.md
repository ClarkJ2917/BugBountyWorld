## [](#header-1)Who we are

This is a normal paragraph following a header. GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

## [](#header-2) Our mission

We are on a mission to make the Internet more secure. We believe in helping hackers/researchers learn about security by helping them interact with each other, share knowledge, guide each other and help everyone to secure the internet.

We want to make the bug bounty community more open and connected. Help us with it and use the hashtag [#bugbountyworld](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23bugbountyworld) on Twitter to support us.

Note: Do not confuse us with @bugbountyforum. Bug Bounty Forum is a closed slack-group managed by other people.
