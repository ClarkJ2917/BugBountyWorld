<h1>Bug Bounty World</h1>

<h3>Mission</h3>
<p>On a mission to make internet secure. We believe in helping hackers/researchers learn about security by helping them interact with each other, share knowledge, guide each other and help everyone to secure the internet.
 
We want to make this bugbounty community more open and connected. Help us with it and use #bugbountyworld on twitter to support us.

Note: Do not confuse us with @bugbountyforum. Bug bounty forum is a closed slack-group managed by other people.
