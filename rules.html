    </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Try to use real names on slack. People like to communicate with real people.</li>
        <li>Do not abuse anyone or offend anyone.😧 If you do so you will be banned from slack. Everyone is here to learn from each other so learn and help learn. 🙂 </li>
        <li>Use different channels according to their purpose. E.g. Use `#music` channel to talk/share about music ONLY.💃 🕺 </li>
        <li>Do not pollute the channels with meaningless messages.🤢</li>
        <li>Do not bombard anyone’s inbox with messages. They may get annoyed and we don’t want that.😟 Remember, hackers are busy. They have family, work, etc. to do. If you do not get any reply please be patient and continue with your work.</li>
        <li>When replying to a specific message or comment in any channel, try to make use of `message threads`. <br>Refer: <a href="https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/115000769927-Message-threads">https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/115000769927-Message-threads </a></li>
        <li>If you are working in a team with other hackers then you can create `private` channel with your buddies and carry on your conversation there.👨‍👧‍👦 This will help lower noise in public channels. </li>
